This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in TypeScript: type mismatches that only surface at runtime. The `add` function is declared to accept two numbers but in the example code, we are passing it a string and a number which passes the TypeScript compiler, but not the runtime.  The solution demonstrates how to enforce stricter type checking using type guards or assertions to prevent this kind of error.
